	<div id="problems">
		<h3> Problems </h3>
			<p> This lab was soooooo difficult.We were entirely confused on how to incorporate the jQuery functions correctly, while the lab assignment's wordage exponentially added to our confusion. We were stuck for a very long time while searching the internet for answers on how to complete the lab. We finally reffered back to the powerpoint and continued our efforts, which finally payed off.  </p>
