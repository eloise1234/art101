		<h1> Lab 3 File Structures </h1>
		<p> This lab consisted of making a local file system and further making index.html files for our structure and lab 3. </p>
		<h2> Challenges </h2>
		<p> This lab was partially challenging and confusing, yet we quickly figured out that we already had the file structure preset in our Art101 folder with all the necessary websites attached. </p>
		<h3> Results </h3>
		<p> This website is the result (of our hard labour)! </p>
