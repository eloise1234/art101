	<h1> Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>

	<div id="challenge">
	<h2> Challenges </h2>
		<p> In this lab we had to use a javascript console and input different variables of our most preferred methods of transportation and our vehicle as an array and an object respectively. We were then asked to reference the variables and print them out in the console. Next, we needed to input these variables into a Javascript file and print them out according to their type (array or object). </p>
	</div>

	<div id="problems">
		<h3> Problems </h3>
			<p> We faced a problem with getting the console log to print the object, and we figured out how concatenation conflicts with non string variables, and how to get around it by using a comma instead.  </p>
