	<div id="challenge">
	<h2> Challenges </h2>
		<p> For this lab, we needed to create a input text box that allows the user to type in their name. With the addition of a sumbit button, the user finds out which Harry Potter house they are placed, based on the length of their name. </p>

		<h3> Problems </h3>
			<p> Due to what we had learned in class, we were able to figure out the steps we needed to complete the code. We had some problems with the addEventListener method, but after fixing some issues with its syntax we were on our way. </p>
